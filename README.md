# anet_api_sandbox

## This repo will be used to test the Authorize.net API with python. 
1. The code base will start with the code example that Authorize.net provides
2. Code will be modified over time
3. This is for Sandbox environment but can be used in production
4. You can use the test credentials that are provided(API loginID and TransactionKey). However, if you
you want to see these results on Authorize.net, I strongly suggest getting your own free sandbox account
